                            People are eating fewer and fewer eggs, except the rich, who are consuming much more than
                            others.
                        </p>
                        <p class="subtitle is-5">
                            The National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey show declining egg consumption among
                            most income groups,
                            despite ups and downs in egg prices between 2013 and 2023.
                        </p>
                        <p class="subtitle is-5">
                            The survey asks particpants to report all the food they have consumed within the past 24
                            hours
                            and documents the specific dishes and their nutritional values.

                            Families whose income is four times or more than the poverty threshold are eating way more
                            eggs than other income groups in recent years.

                        <p class="subtitle is-5">
                            According to the <a href="https://data.bls.gov/timeseries/APU0000708111">U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics</a>, the average egg price peaked a little in
                            2015, remained low from
                            2016 to 2021, and peaked again between 2022 and 2023.
                        </p>
                        <p class="subtitle is-5">
                            However, egg consumption levels do not seem to echo the price fluctuation.
                        </p>
                        <p class="subtitle is-5">
                            "We don't even look at eggs now." Selene Henry, 26, earning $1400 a month, said she and her
                            mom used to get eggs
                            on every grocery trip. "I just don't like them anymore."
                        </p>
                        <p class="subtitle is-5">
                            Aggie Ganz, 69, said she and her husband never used that many eggs, just "the usual amount."
                            They live on social security and receive $36,000 a year.
                        </p>
                        <p class="subtitle is-5">
                            On the other hand, Nikolas Panagios, 27, earning $150,000 a year, said he persistently buys
                            a good amount of eggs because he is on
                            a work-out diet.
                        </p>
                        <p class="subtitle is-5">
                            Panagios said a few dollars of price fluctuation wouldn't change his diet,
                            but "when the eggs are more expensive
                            than the chicken, it doesn't make sense" to stick to eggs as his source of protein.
