                        People are eating fewer and fewer eggs, except the rich, who are consuming much more than
                        others.
                    </p>
                    <p class="subtitle is-6">
                        The National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey shows declining egg consumption among
                        most income groups,
                        in spite of ups and downs in egg prices between 2013 and 2023.
                    </p>
                    <p class="subtitle is-6">
                        The survey asks participants to report all the food they have consumed within the past 24
                        hours
                        and documents the specific dishes and their nutritional values.

                    <p class="subtitle is-6">
                        Families whose income is four times or more than the poverty threshold are eating more
                        eggs than other income groups in recent years.

                        Egg prices peaked and dipped in the past 10 years, according to the <a
                            href="https://data.bls.gov/timeseries/APU0000708111">U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics</a>,
                        but egg consumption levels did not echo that fluctuation.
                    </p>
                    <p class="subtitle is-6">
                        Here are some shoppers from different age and income groups.
                        They were shopping at City Acres in Long Island City, New York when asked about their egg-buying
                        habits.
                    </p>
                    <p class="subtitle is-6">
                        “We don't even look at eggs now,” said Selene Henry, 26, who earns $1,400 a month. She and her
                        mom used to get eggs on every grocery trip. “I just don't like them anymore.”
                    </p>
                    <p class="subtitle is-6">
                        Aggie Ganz, 69, said she and her husband never used that many eggs, just “the usual amount.”
                        They live on social security and receive $36,000 a year.
                    </p>
                    <p class="subtitle is-6">
                        On the other hand, Nikolas Panagios, 27, who earns $150,000 a year, said he persistently buys
                        a good amount of eggs because he is on
                        a work-out diet.
                    </p>
                    <p class="subtitle is-6">
                        Panagios said a few dollars of fluctuation wouldn't change his diet,
                        but “when the eggs are more expensive than the chicken, it doesn't make sense” to stick to eggs
                        as his source of protein.
