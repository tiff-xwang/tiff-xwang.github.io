                <p class="subtitle is-6">
                    China’s top coffee chain Luckin Coffee toured different New York City hotspots with a series of
                    coffee truck pop-ups,
                    warming up for the openings of its first two U.S. stores at the end of the month.

            <div class="step" id="step2">

                <p class="subtitle is-6">
                    On the second day of the promotion, the line for Luckin’s free coffee stretched two blocks long in
                    90-degree weather in Soho.
                    The company’s marketing and business strategy helped announce the brand to loyal Luckin lovers and
                    onlookers alike.

                <p class="subtitle is-6">
                    “I actually really like it,” summer student intern Paige Yu said after her first sip of Luckin’s
                    matcha coconut latte.
                    “I tend to like sweeter drinks, so the coconut is a great addition.”
                </p>

                <p class="subtitle is-6">
                    Luckin’s expansion into the U.S. will spark new competition and opportunities in a saturated market
                    of Asian and domestic beverage makers.
                </p>

                <p class="subtitle is-6">
                    Stylish tea brands that are popular in China are popping up all over New York: HEYTEA opened 14
                    locations in a year; Naisnow and LELECHA have plastered their new storefronts with signage.
                </p>

                <p class="subtitle is-6">
                    But there are few Chinese coffee brands like Luckin.
                </p>

                <p class="subtitle is-6">
                    Luckin Coffee has over 24,000 stores in Asia as of the end of March, surpassing Starbucks’ 19,000
                    stores worldwide.
                </p>

                <p class="subtitle is-6">
                    It is known for its game plan of seizing the market with massive outreach and dealing with the debt
                    later.
                </p>


                <p class="subtitle is-6">
                    Luckin CEO Jinyi Guo acknowledged that they even “opened slightly more stores than initially
                    planned” in the latest earnings call.
                </p>

                <p class="subtitle is-6">
                    The company’s annual report said it grossed $4.7 billion in revenue in 2024, a nearly 40% increase
                    from the previous year, thanks to rapid store and customer growth.
                </p>

                <p class="subtitle is-6">
                    However, “decreasing customer spending, increasing competition, [and] declining growth of China’s
                    coffee industry” prompted Luckin to seek new sources of revenue outside China, in Singapore,
                    Malaysia and now the U.S.

                    coffee by signing up for the store app, a $0.99 coupon for any drink and a tote bag for tagging the
                    store on social media.

                    There were also hidden phrases of encouragement in the cup sleeves, such as “You’re doing great,
                    even if it feels not” and “Chase your dreams, and luck comes along,” that became sought-after
                    souvenirs.

                    News of the event spread on social media platforms like RedNote and Instagram, tailoring to young
                    people in New York who are attuned to such promotion culture, many of whom showed up at the
                    hour-long lines.

                <p class="subtitle is-6">

                <p class="subtitle is-6">
                    Instagram food blogger Emma Newhouse said the drinks looked really good. “And that was just like, ‘I

                <p class="subtitle is-6">
                    “It sounds like their target audience is going to be sort of late teens, early 20 somethings”, New

                <p class="subtitle is-6">
                    Winer said their social media strategy “might be effective against Starbucks, which has a broader

                    As Chinese consumers’ spending power dropped, Chinese companies like Luckin and Miniso were born out
                    of a need for cheap but cute products. After Miniso successfully opened four locations in Manhattan,
                    Luckin is coming to operate with the same business model.

                    A promotion page on Luckin’s app mentions their drinks will be priced under $6.75, which customers
                    at the pop-ups didn’t think was a bargain.

                    On top of that, Winer said Luckin’s two stores in Manhattan aren’t that many and “they’re gonna have

                    And those locations are surrounded by Starbucks, budget chains like Dunkin’ and McDonald’s, and
                    independent cafés.

                    But Winer said he sees potential for Luckin in New York City, which is filled with young people with
