					Tiffany: In New York City, friends and friends-to-bes are gathering to play a new kind of role-playing game. 
				</p>

				<p class="subtitle is-6">
					In Chinese, it's called <i>juubensha</i>. And it's a chance for people to become strange characters and play out dramatic scenes with each other. 
				</p>

				<p class="subtitle is-6">
					A lot of <i>juubensha</i> rooms nestle in old buildings near Koreatown. When you step out of the cranky elevator, it’s a whole new world. 
				</p>

				
				<p class="subtitle is-6">
					[room noise]
				</p>

				<p class="subtitle is-6">
					This is Sense Seven Lab. Tonight, Chloe Li and her friends are acting out a play stemmed from Chinese mythology. 
				</p>


				<p class="subtitle is-6">
					<b>Chloe: it's almost like we are watching a broadway show, but you're one of the actor or actress.</b>
				</p>


				<p class="subtitle is-6">
					They are handed a packet of information about their characters. 
				</p>

				<p class="subtitle is-6">
					Chloe is playing an old man who opened up a tavern for lovers to come together. He’s kind of like the Chinese cupid. 
					She starts by introducing her character to the other players and the whole night is performed in Mandarin.
				</p>

				<p class="subtitle is-6">
					<b>Chloe: I'm Yue Lao...(in Mandarin)</b>
				</p>

				<p class="subtitle is-6">
					And then, a paid actor starts the drama. Perhaps there is a murder, or a poignant love story. What happens next is up to their acting and interactions.
				</p>


				<p class="subtitle is-6">
					Chloe’s favorite script is set in an unspecified time in ancient China and her favorite role is this girl who eventually becomes an empress of her land.
				</p>



				<p class="subtitle is-6">
					<b>Chloe: She was abandoned by her father and she went through a lot of child abuse. 
						A lot of people was bullying her and her boyfriend left her, cheated on her, and her sister, or like, her friends betrayed her. A lot of things like that but she didn't just give up.</b>
				</p>

				<p class="subtitle is-6">
					<b>I feel like we went through something similar. We share a lot of things in common, but I hope in the future, one day, I can become like as successful as her.</b>
				</p>

				<p class="subtitle is-6">
					There are many types of <i>juubensha</i> scripts: some are crime-based, some are emotional ones that bring players into their characters’ journeys and they’d feel like they've had a whole life.
				</p>

				<p class="subtitle is-6">
					<b>Chloe: I felt like I don't have to be by myself, so I can resonate with some other people and then we feel the same thing, so I can just like feel detached with the real world for like a couple hours.
					</b>
				</p>

				<p class="subtitle is-6">
					Chloe says these games go on for seven to eight hours at the very least and often up to 12 hours.
				</p>


				<p class="subtitle is-6">
					The whole night is helped along by professional actors like Dakki Ji, who manages another <i>juubensha</i> shop called Noah’s Ark. 
					She’s a 22-year-old Theater major at Barnard College.
				</p>

				<p class="subtitle is-6">
					<b>Dakki: Their acting sometimes gives information, or sometimes makes the players more, um, I don't know, empathize with the whole story. And yeah, it's more, it's kind of like "Sleep No More", if you know about that. 
						Because it's like a whole immersive experience for the players. </b>
				</p>

				<p class="subtitle is-6">
					Dakki says they source their scripts from <i>juubensha</i> exhibitions in China. And they charge $60-120 per person for the night.
				</p>

				<p class="subtitle is-6">
					From the players, to actors, to store managers, everyone in this industry is staying because they love acting and the art of <i>juubensha</i>. 

				</p>

				<p class="subtitle is-6">
					The manager of Sense Seven Lab is Christina Zhen. She was trained in Public Health, but likes this job better.
				</p>

				<p class="subtitle is-6">
					Christina Zhen says she takes a percentage from the store’s revenue and her earnings vary from $3,000-6,000 a month.
				</p>

				<p class="subtitle is-6">
					<b>
						Christina: We love acting. We love staying with different people and then bring up different performance to them and why we are doing it so long, 
						even though we're not gaining like a lot, a lot of profit, but we're still doing that because of the place, and then the people who are staying with us.

					</b>
				</p>

				<p class="subtitle is-6">
					
					As for Chloe’s game where she was the old man in Chinese mythology, the game went until 5 a.m. in the morning. The old man actually opened the tavern to reunite with his own lover. 
					When he eventually met her again after hundreds of years, she asked him: have I seen you before? And he said: I’ve been waiting for you. 

				</p>

				<p class="subtitle is-6">
					From Columbia Radio News, I’m Tiffany Wang.
